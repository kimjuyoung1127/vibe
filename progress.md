## Development Process & Guidelines

### Implementation Approach
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: All UI elements built as reusable, independent components following Atomic Design principles
2. **Modularization Strategy**: Components systematically classified by functionality and complexity
3. **Progressive Development**: Features implemented incrementally with thorough testing at each stage
4. **Code Reusability**: Global components (navigation) reused across pages to maintain consistency

### Coding Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all components and interfaces
- **Component Structure**: Each component in its own file with clear naming conventions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes

### File Organization
- **Global Components**: `/app/components/` - Navigation and shared UI elements
- **Main Page**: `/app/mainpage/` - Homepage sections
- **Projects System**: `/app/projects/` - Projects listing, detail, and creation
- **Tool & Tech Reviews**: `/app/gear/` - Tool and technology reviews
- **Community**: `/app/community/` - Coding lounge and discussions
- **News**: `/app/news/` - Latest IT news articles
- **Dynamic Routes**: Next.js dynamic routing for individual pages

### UI/UX Implementation
- **Modern Retro Pop Art Theme**: Bright colors, bold elements, and vibrant accents
- **Visual Effects**: Glassmorphism, drop shadows, and interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **User Feedback**: Interactive elements with hover and active states

### 11. User Profile Implementation
- [x] Created user profile directory for organizing profile components
- [x] Implemented main profile page (page.tsx) with user information display

- [x] Created modular components for profile editing:
  - BasicInfoEditor.tsx (avatar upload, username, display name, bio)
  - SocialLinksEditor.tsx (social media links with add/remove functionality)
  - AccountSettingsEditor.tsx (email, connected accounts, notifications, language)
- [x] Added profile button to TopNav component with consistent styling
- [x] Componentized search functionality into SearchBar.tsx
- [x] Componentized user profile section in sidebar into UserProfile.tsx
