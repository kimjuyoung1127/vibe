# Progress Update - October 5, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mobile Viewport Horizontal Scrolling Issue
**Problem**: The main page was not properly constrained on mobile devices, causing horizontal scrolling and layout overflow.

**Solution**: 
- Restructured the main layout in `app/layout.tsx` to use a relative positioning approach
- Changed from a flex container with two children (Navbar + Content) to a structure where the navbar is positioned independently
- Used `fixed` positioning for the desktop navbar and proper content offset with `lg:ml-72`

**Result**: The main page now properly respects mobile viewport dimensions without horizontal scrolling.

### 2. HeroSection Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem**: The HeroSection component had fixed dimensions and sizing that didn't adapt well to mobile screens.

**Solution**:
- Adjusted minimum height from 500px to 400px for mobile (`min-h-[400px] sm:min-h-[500px]`)
- Refined padding and spacing for different screen sizes
- Improved text sizing with responsive classes (`text-3xl sm:text-4xl` for heading)
- Removed flex-row layout on small screens to prevent horizontal button layout issues

**Result**: The HeroSection now displays appropriately sized elements on mobile devices.

### 3. Horizontal Scrolling Components Enhancement
**Problem**: The main page components (LatestProjects, VibeNews, WeeklyVibeRanking) had horizontal scrolling but needed improvements for better mobile experience.

**Solution**:
- Added gradient overlays to indicate scrollable content
- Implemented snap scrolling (`snap-x snap-mandatory`) for better mobile interaction
- Added smooth scrolling behavior (`scroll-smooth`)
- Adjusted card widths for mobile (`w-64 sm:w-72`) 
- Added text truncation to prevent overflow
- Improved touch scrolling experience

**Result**: Horizontal scrolling components now have a much better user experience on mobile devices.

### 4. Desktop Navbar Visibility
**Problem**: After fixing the mobile layout, the desktop navbar disappeared.

**Solution**:
- Corrected the navbar container classes to `hidden lg:flex`
- Properly positioned the navbar with `fixed` positioning
- Maintained content offset with `lg:ml-72` for desktop

**Result**: Desktop navbar is now visible and functional while maintaining mobile fixes.

## Overall Impact

- Mobile users now experience a properly constrained viewport without horizontal scrolling
- Desktop users continue to have access to the sidebar navigation
- Main page components have improved mobile touch interactions
- All changes maintain the retro pop art design aesthetic of Vibe Hub
