### 2. News Article Components

#### NewsArticleDetail.tsx

- **Consistent styling**: Aligned with other content creation forms
- **Proper bucket configuration**: Maintained `news_images` bucket for image uploads
- **Type compatibility**: Handled font_preference separately since it's not in NewsArticle type

### 3. Type Definition Updates

- **VibeCheckButtonProps**: Added "tool_review" to targetType union for proper TypeScript support

## Technical Improvements

### Editor Component Integration
- All content types (projects, tool reviews, news articles) now use consistent editor components
- VibeTipTapEditor provides rich text formatting capabilities
- VibeEditorRenderer ensures consistent content display across all content types

### Route Handling
- Fixed useParams implementation in ToolTechReviewDetail to properly retrieve route parameters
- Ensured all dynamic routes function correctly

### Styling and UI

- Standardized component layouts across different content types
- Improved accessibility and responsiveness

## Impact
- **Enhanced user experience**: Consistent editor components across all content types
- **Better readability**: Improved styling and layout for content display
- **Developer experience**: Unified editor components reduce code duplication
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt tags and semantic HTML structure
- **Performance**: Optimized image handling and conditional rendering

## Image Display Consistency Improvements

### ToolTechReviewDetail.tsx
- Updated image display to match NewsArticleDetail style using `<img>` tags
- Changed from background image to proper img element with `object-cover`
- Set consistent height (`h-96`) and styling (rounded corners, shadow)

### ProjectShowcaseDetail.tsx
- Updated single image display to match NewsArticleDetail style
- Used `h-96` for single images and `h-80` for multiple images in grid layout
- Maintained grid layout for multiple project images while ensuring single image consistency
- Added proper fallback when no images are available

### ToolTechReviewCard.tsx
- Changed from background image approach to `<img>` tag implementation
- Added consistent styling with rounded corners and object-cover
- Implemented fallback placeholder for when no image is available
- Maintained card aspect ratio while improving image quality

## TypeScript Error Resolution

### ToolTechReviewForm.tsx
- Fixed type mismatch error related to category field naming inconsistency
- Updated types file to align with implementation (changed from 'category' to 'categoryTags' to match actual implementation)
- Ensured all component interfaces match the form state structure
- Corrected MediaSection component usage to pass only required properties

## General UI/UX & Refactoring Improvements

### 1. Mobile Search Bar Fix
- **File(s) affected**: `topnav.tsx`, `SearchBar.tsx`
- **Improvement**: Fixed a UI bug where the search bar would overflow its container in the mobile navigation menu. Also adjusted styling to prevent the virtual keyboard from obscuring the input field during typing.

### 2. Dynamic "Time Ago" Feature
- **File(s) affected**: `NewsArticleDetail.tsx`, `NewsArticles.tsx`
- **Improvement**: Replaced the hardcoded "5 min read" placeholder with a dynamic "time ago" feature. The UI now correctly displays how long ago an article was published (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago", "3 days ago").

### 3. Secure HTML Content Rendering
- **File(s) affected**: `ToolTechReviewCard.tsx`
- **Improvement**: Fixed a bug where raw HTML from the database was rendered as plain text. Implemented `isomorphic-dompurify` to sanitize and correctly render the HTML content, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities while maintaining intended text styling.

### 4. Live Demo Link Enhancement
- **File(s) affected**: `ProjectCreateForm.tsx`, `ProjectShowcaseDetail.tsx`
- **Improvement**: To increase visibility and user engagement, the "Live Demo" link is now a prominent, styled button.
  - In the project detail page, it's located between the main image and the content.
  - In the project creation form, its input field has been moved to a more central position to emphasize its importance.

### 5. Component Refactoring

#### Search & Filter Accordion
- **File(s) affected**: `SearchAndFilter.tsx`, `components/Accordion.tsx` (new)
- **Improvement**: Created a new, reusable `Accordion.tsx` component. Refactored the `SearchAndFilter` component to use this accordion, allowing the filter options to be collapsed by default for a cleaner UI.

#### ToolTechReviewForm Refactoring
- **File(s) affected**: `ToolTechReviewForm.tsx`
- **Improvement**: Refactored the form to use the dedicated `MediaSection.tsx` component, improving code modularity. Also unified the form's state management into a single object, enhancing maintainability.
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected a critical bug introduced during the refactoring where the "Save Draft" functionality was broken. The feature is now fully restored and functional.

## Next Steps
- Testing across different browsers and devices
- Performance optimization for image-heavy articles
- Potential expansion of Vibe editor features to other content areas
