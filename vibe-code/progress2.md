## October 7, 2025: Fixing Post Issue When Selecting Categories

**Main Work:** Fixed post issue caused by button type error in AdvancedSelect component

**Status:** Completed

### Debugging Process Summary

1.  **Issue:** When selecting a category on the gear/review creation page, the form was automatically submitted.
2.  **Initial Diagnosis:**
    *   When selecting a category, the form state was recognized as completed, causing automatic submission.
    *   Investigated elements in the AdvancedSelect component that could trigger form submission.
3.  **Issue Narrowing:** 
    *   The issue was in the AdvancedSelect component used in CategorizationSection of ToolTechReviewForm.tsx.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** 
    *   Multiple buttons inside the AdvancedSelect.tsx component didn't have explicit `type` attributes, defaulting to `type="submit"`.
    *   This caused form submission upon any button click (select, delete, expand/collapse).

5.  **Final Solution:**
    *   Added `type="button"` attribute explicitly to all button elements inside AdvancedSelect.tsx.
    *   Select/delete/collapse/expand functions now only change state without form submission.
    *   Posting function now works only when the Submit button is clicked.

### What I Learned from This Work

- **Importance of Default Element Behavior in Forms:** Button elements inside forms default to `type="submit"` without explicit type designation.
- **Necessity of User-Centric Design:** Functions users expect (category selection) and actual functions (form submission) should be separated to avoid unintended linking.
- **Caution with Reusable Components:** Components that might be used outside forms should have their internal element types clearly specified to prevent unexpected behavior.

2.  **Created `ads.txt` File:**
    *   Created `public/ads.txt` file to allow Google to verify the site's ad inventory.

3.  **Created and Relocated Essential Policy Pages:**
    *   Created essential pages for AdSense approval: `About Us`, `Privacy Policy`, `Terms of Service`, `Cookie Policy`, `Content Guidelines`.
    *   Moved pages from the `google` directory to the `app` directory following Next.js routing rules to fix 404 errors.

4.  **Updated Sitemap and Robots Files:**
    *   Updated domain addresses in `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts` to `https://vibehub.tech` to allow search engines to properly crawl and index the site.

5.  **Fixed Footer Links:**

### Updated Directory Structure

```
app/
├── google/
│   ├── about/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── content-guidelines/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── cookie-policy/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── privacy-policy/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── terms-of-service/
│       └── page.tsx
├── ... (previous directory structure)
```

### What I Learned from This Work

- **Next.js Routing:** Next.js App Router operates based on the `app` directory, so pages were crawled and indexed properly.

5.  **Fixed Footer Links:**
    *   Updated `footer.tsx` file to ensure all policy page links point to the correct paths.

### Updated Directory Structure

```
app/
├── google/
│   ├── about/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── content-guidelines/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── cookie-policy/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── privacy-policy/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── terms-of-service/
│       └── page.tsx
├── ... (previous directory structure)
```

### What I Learned from This Work

- **Next.js Routing:** Next.js App Router operates based on the `app` directory, so page files must be located within the `app` directory to function properly. This was confirmed once again.
- **AdSense Requirements:** Learned that AdSense approval requires not just technical setup (AdSense code, `ads.txt`) but also policy pages (`About Us`, `Privacy Policy`, etc.) and sufficient quality content to increase site credibility.
- **User Experience:** Realized how important it is to provide users with consistent and predictable navigation experience, as demonstrated in the 404 error resolution process.
