## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Vibe Hub (Modern Retro Style - Updated)
Document Version	15.0
Date	2025-09-20
Author	Gemini (Website Architect)

1. Overview
'Vibe Hub a community website for developers who value the "vibe" and environment of coding. Users can share their project experiences in a 'Modern Retro Pop Art' style, discuss and critically review the latest technologies, and connect with peers. The platform aims to encourage active participation through a strong visual identity and personalized 'Vibe' expression, with a long-term goal of monetization through Google AdSense.

2. UI/UX Concept: 'Modern Retro Pop Art'
Color Palette (No Pink as primary):

Backgrounds: Predominantly bright, clean, and vibrant tones (e.g., electric blue, lime green, bright yellow, aqua, cool white/light gray). Gradients can be used for smooth transitions.

Accents/Points: Bold, high-saturation pop colors (e.g., vivid orange, deep purple, hot magenta, emerald green, sky blue) to emphasize key information and interactive elements. Minimize dull grays, favoring lighter, cool-toned neutrals where needed.



3. Development Guidelines & Architecture Principles
Component-Based Architecture (CBA): All UI elements of the project will be built as reusable, independent components. This is crucial for maximizing maintainability and scalability.

Modularization Strategy (referencing Atomic Design): Components will be systematically classified and managed based on their functionality and complexity.

Atoms: Smallest UI elements like buttons, inputs, icons. (Consistency maintained via Google Stitch).

Molecules: Small functional units combining atoms, e.g., search bar (input + button), profile info (image + name).

Organisms: Complex UI sections combining molecules, e.g., header, project card, comment list.

Templates: Overall page layout structures, e.g., sidebar + main content layout.

Pages: Final user screens populated with actual data.

UI/UX Design Reference & Data Separation Principle:

UI/UX mockups generated by AI tools (e.g., Google Stitch) are to be used solely as a reference for visual style, layout structure, and component design.

During actual website implementation, all example data (text, images, numbers, etc.) contained within the mockup code MUST NOT be used. Instead, real data must be integrated based on the data structures and content requirements defined for each feature (F-01 to F-11) within this PRD. This ensures future maintainability and efficient data management.

4. Core Features (MVP Scope)
F-01: User Authentication

Provide social login through Google or GitHub accounts.

F-02: Content Boards

Site content is divided into four boards based on purpose:

Project Showcase: A core space for sharing project experiences, retrospectives, and giving/receiving feedback.

Tool & Tech Review: A space for real-world reviews of technologies, tools, and hardware.

Coding Lounge: A community space for free communication and discussions in a feed format with infinite scroll.

Vibe News: A dedicated section for the latest AI trends and technology information, curated by administrators.

F-03: 'Vibe' Editor

A hybrid editor used for all post creations.

Markdown-centric: Users can directly paste or upload markdown content (e.g., from README.md).

Per-Post Font Selection: Within the editor, users can select the font to be applied to that specific post from 'Retro Casual' and 'Modern Sans-serif' options (applied only within the post content).

'Vibe' Emphasis Toolbar: Users can select text and click buttons to apply unique site styles consistent with the Modern Retro theme:

Pop Color Highlight: (High-saturation colors matching the retro theme)

Alert/Info Box: (Clean pop-art style UI)

Pixel Art Banner: (8-bit/16-bit style)

Colorful Code Block: (Light background, emphasized code colors)

F-04: Enhanced Project Showcase Navigation & Interaction

Like Feature: Only Project Showcase posts will have a 'Like (Vibe Check)' function.

Comment Feature: Users can add comments to Project Showcase posts.

Comment authors can edit or delete their own comments.

Comments can only contain plain text; markdown or 'Vibe Emphasis' features are not provided.

Category/Filtering: Provide categorization (tags) and filtering features to easily explore projects on the Project Showcase board. Classification criteria:

Topic: Core content/domain of the project (e.g., Web Service, Mobile App, Game, AI/ML).

Creator Type: Whether the project creator is a developer or non-developer (Options: Developer, Non-Developer).

Main Tech Stack: Key technologies used in project implementation (e.g., React, Node.js, Python, AWS, multi-select allowed).

Main Coding Tool: Primary IDE or tool used for project development (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Vim).

F-05: 'Weekly Vibe' Ranking

The main page automatically displays Project Showcase posts with the most 'likes' from the past 7 days. Ranking items will be highlighted with bright accent colors and soft, pop-art style shadow effects.

F-06: Vibe News (Latest AI & Tech Trends) Section

A dedicated section for the latest AI trends and technology information.

Content for this section will be published via the Admin-only AI Content Pipeline (F-07).

Posts will be reviewed and published by the administrator, aiming for SEO optimization.

Each article includes a "Source" link that users can copy, and related articles section.

F-07: AI Content Automation Pipeline (For Admin - To be implemented directly by the operator)

When the operator inputs a topic keyword in the admin page, it calls an LLM API to generate a draft Vibe News article.

The generated draft is reviewed and edited by the operator before being published on the site.

Note: This feature will be implemented by the operator in the latter half of the project, utilizing technologies from their other projects, including Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI.

F-08: Mobile Responsive Design

All site features must be optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop environments.

F-09: Global Side Navigation (Reddit Style)

Layout: A fixed sidebar on the left of the website will provide global navigation (referencing Reddit's style).

Desktop Behavior:

Defaults to an 'expanded state', showing both icons and text labels.

A toggle button will allow switching to a 'collapsed state', showing only icons. The main content area should dynamically adjust its width.

Mobile Behavior:

Hidden by default.

A prominent hamburger menu icon in a sticky top header reveals the sidebar as an overlay sliding from the left.

A clear close button ('X' icon) or tapping outside the overlay should close it.

Content: Includes links to Home, Projects Showcase, Tool & Tech Review, Coding Lounge, Vibe News, and "My Vibe" / "Profile" access.

F-10: Main Page Purpose Clarification (Homepage Value Proposition)

Hero Section: Placed at the top of the main page, content clearly communicates the website's core value and purpose.

Headline: "Your Code, Your Vibe." or "Future Code, Here Now."

Sub-headline: "The hub for Vibe Coders to share creations, discuss tech, and inspire each other."

Call-to-Action: "Share My Vibe" or "Discover Vibe" buttons.

Section Composition: Includes 'Weekly Vibe' Ranking, Latest Posts preview, and Latest Vibe News articles to encourage user engagement and information discovery.

F-11: User Profile Customization

Logged-in users can customize certain elements on their profile page.

Profile Image/Avatar: Upload pixel art avatars or pop-color style profile images consistent with the 'Modern Retro' concept.

Profile Background: Select simple retro patterns, abstract pop art backgrounds, etc., to express individuality.

Purpose: Allow users to make a strong, memorable impression through unique profiles when featured (e.g., in 'Weekly Vibe' ranking).

5. Technology Stack
Frontend: Next.js (utilizing Google Stitch for styling consistency)

Backend & DB: Supabase

Deployment: Netlify

6. Future Considerations
Multilingual Support: Review implementation for future global user expansion.

User-to-user messaging (DM) feature.

Additional comment functionality for other boards (beyond Project Showcase).

UI/UX Design Guidance for AI Generators (e.g., Google Stitch)
This section provides specific instructions for AI-powered design tools like Google Stitch to ensure the generated UI/UX code aligns with the project's vision and technical requirements.

Primary Directive for AI (Extremely Important):
Generate React JSX code (compatible with Next.js) and Tailwind CSS classes. DO NOT use standard HTML. Avoid any inline <script> tags for interactivity; instead, provide the HTML structure and Tailwind classes that conceptually support dynamic states (e.g., isSidebarOpen props for sidebar toggling), implying these will be managed by React state.

Data Handling Directive for AI:
Crucially, use only generic, abstract placeholders (e.g., "Project Title", "User Name", "Image Placeholder", src="/placeholder-image.jpg") for all textual content, image URLs, and numerical values within the generated code. DO NOT include specific mock data (e.g., "AI-Powered Music Generator", googleusercontent.com URLs, concrete like counts). The purpose is to provide the UI/UX structure and style, not the data content.

Layout & Page Requirements:

Global Layout (Applies to ALL pages):

Persistent Left Sidebar (Global Navigation - Reddit Style):

Desktop (>= 768px): Always present. Default: Expanded (icons + text). Collapsible to 'icons only' state via toggle (conceptual isSidebarOpen prop). Content: Home, Projects Showcase, Tool & Tech Review, Coding Lounge, Vibe News, Profile (placeholder).

Mobile (< 768px): Hidden by default. Accessed via a prominent hamburger menu in the top header. Slides in as an overlay from left (conceptual isMobileSidebarOpen prop). Close via 'X' button or outside tap.

Sticky Top Header (Global):

Contains site logo ("Vibe Hub"), title, "New Post" button, notification icon, user avatar/profile access.

Mobile: Must include the hamburger menu icon.

Search Bar: Integrated/accessible.

Right Sidebar (Desktop Only, >= 1024px): Placeholder for "Trending Vibe" / "Top Communities" widgets. Disappears on smaller screens.

Specific Page Content Areas:

Generate separate React JSX code snippets for the main content area of each page listed below. Each snippet should clearly demonstrate the page's purpose and apply the "Modern Retro Pop Art" theme.

Homepage (/): Hero Section, "Weekly Vibe Ranking" (3-5 cards), "Latest Projects" (3-6 cards), "Latest Vibe News" (3 articles).

Projects Showcase List Page (/projects): Page Title, Description, Filter/Sort Section (dropdowns, search bar), Project Card Grid (e.g., 6 generic cards), Pagination.

Project Showcase Detail Page (/projects/[id]): Breadcrumbs, Project Article (placeholder rich content: paragraphs, blockquotes, code blocks), "Vibe Check" button, Comments Section (list of generic comments, comment input form).

Tool & Tech Review List Page (/gear): Page Title, Description, Review Card Grid (e.g., 6 generic cards), Pagination.

Tool & Tech Review Detail Page (/gear/[id]): Review Article (placeholder rich content), Author Info, Tags, Comments Section.

Coding Lounge List Page (/community): Page Title, Description, Post Feed (forum-style generic posts with infinite scroll), "Create New Post" Button.

Coding Lounge Create Post Page (/community/create): Form for creating new community posts with title, content, and tags fields.

Vibe News List Page (/news): Page Title, Description, News Article Cards (generic thumbnail, title, summary, category), Pagination.

Vibe News Detail Page (/news/[id]): News Article (placeholder rich content), Author Info, "Explore More" section with source link and copy functionality, Related News section.

User Profile Page (/profile): User Info (generic avatar, username, bio, customizable background placeholder), "My Projects" Section, "My Reviews" Section, "My Comments" Section, Edit Profile Button.

Interaction Details (Global):
All interactive elements should clearly indicate state with vibrant accent colors and subtle hover/active effects (e.g., pop-out shadows, slight scale, brighter glow).

Output Format:
Provide the complete, single HTML file including <head> with necessary font imports (Orbitron for headlines, Press Start 2P for small accents/pixelated feel, Inter for body text), and Tailwind CSS setup (using CDN). Ensure all CSS classes are used within React JSX className attributes. Use inline Tailwind classes or define them within a <style type="text/tailwindcss"> block. Each page's content should be clearly separated using JSX comments ({/* Homepage Content */}) or distinct id attributes on the main content container.
